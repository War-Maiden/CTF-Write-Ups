Have you ever wondered what people can know about you? Probably not. But if you have uploaded anything on the internet, chances are that someone can trace it back to you or use it to trace you. Would you like to be able to do the same? Try the OhSINT room where you get the chance to track someone's online shenanigans and even (!) crack their password! (The link to the OhSINT room can be found here: https://tryhackme.com/room/ohsint )

What you'll need:
- Your favourite EXIF viewer (in this write-up, I'm using https://exifdata.com/index.php an online tool that lets you view picture metadata).
- Google
- A lot of patience for the upcoming HTML games.

When you download the file offered by the room you get a very popular landscape photo (see below):
